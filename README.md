It would be nice if we could look at the stars as if they were like little balls on a table. Or can we actually?
## What do we need it for?
**starData** - Windows Forms(.NET Framework) application, which allows you to:
+ read csv file with star([astronomical object](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star)) data;
+ generate a new star with **your** data settings;
+ convert to XYZ-coordinates;
+ simulate in blender(python scripts);
